	<p><strong>Section II: Endorsement types</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Transaction Type: </strong>Place a check in the box for each transaction type that  applies.</p>
    <p><strong>Original</strong>:  An  applicant must apply for an original MMC if they  have never held any  Coast  Guard issued credential or if  the first credential issued to applicant  after their  previous credential was revoked pursuant  to  46 CFR. Complete the application  and  ensure all mandatory  documents  are  contained with  application.</p>
    <p><strong>Renewal</strong>: A credential may be renewed at any  time during its validity and for  one  year after expiration; you must be qualified to renew all Domestic /STCW  Officer  and  Rating endorsements to receive a new five year expiration  date. Â An MMC  renewal-only  transaction will automatically be issued with a date that coincides with the expiration date of your previous credential or a date that is 8-months  from the time the Coast Guard accepted your application,<br>
      whichever is sooner.  Page 1, Section II of  this form provides  you  the opportunity to decline this post-dating  feature and receive your MMC immediately.</p>
    <p><strong>Duplicate</strong>: In the event of a lost credential, a statement describing the circumstances  of the loss must be submitted with the application.  The duplicate will have the same authority, wording  and  expiration  date as  the lost credential.  If a  person loses a credential by shipwreck or  other casualty that causes  damage to a ship, a duplicate will be issued free of  charge as per  46  CFR. If a person loses a credential by other means  and  applies for a duplicate,  the  appropriate fee set out in 46  CFR  must be  paid. No application from an  alien  for a duplicate credential will be accepted  unless the alien complies with the requirements of 46 CFR.</p>
    <p><strong>Raise of Grade or New Endorsement: </strong>Is defined as an increase in the level of authority and responsibility associated with an officer or  rating endorsement. You must first  hold an MMC before an endorsement is issued for a Raise of  Grade and/or Increase in Scope (i.e. Raise of  Grade of 3rd mate to 2nd mate will not change the expiration date unless specifically requested and renewal requirements are met for all other endorsements on MMC).</p>
    <p><strong>Increase in Scope: </strong>Increase in scope may include a change in horsepower, propulsion or tonnage limitations, or  geographic route restrictions.  You must  first hold an MMC  before an endorsement is issued for a Raise of  Grade and/or  Increase in Scope.  Endorsements  maintain the same expiration  date as  the  credential being  endorsed.</p>
    <p><strong>Document of Continuity: </strong>Documents of continuity do not expire, do not require medical or security evaluations, and do not require  fees. They are a record of  competencies previously held and do not authorize the holder to sail in any capacity listed thereon.</p>
    <p><strong>Description of MMC or Endorsement Desired: </strong>All Mariners will receive a single Merchant Mariner  Credential. Describe all capacities and limitations both  domestic and STCW including tonnage, waters, propulsion mode, horsepower, ratings (Ordinary  Seaman, Able Seaman, QMED-Oiler, etc.), purser,  doctor, radio operator,  continuity, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:  Entry Level Ratings: </strong>There are no professional requirements needed when applying  for  entry level credential. Ratings may include Ordinary  Seaman, Wiper,  and/or Stewards  Department  / Stewards Department (Food Handler - F.H.).  Per  46  CFR Part 10, applicants  requesting Stewards  Department (F.H.)  will be required to submit a statement attesting applicant is  free from communicable disease.</p>
